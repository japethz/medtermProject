                            <p class="text-white"> I am Japeth John Llausas Tahoynon, 20 years old and currently studying in the University of Science and Technology,
                                taking-up Bachelor of Science in Information Technology(IT). I am second in the family with two siblings.
                                My elder sister is in Senior High School, my younger sister is in 4th grade and our parents have rested already.  
                                I like listening music and singing too, sports as well like volleyball, badminton and a little in running. I love adventures
                                and exploring, but I didn't have the time to adventure yet because I have no money for now.
                                <br><br>
                                I am a christian believer, a follower and a servant  of Christ. I want to serve the Lord as one of his faithful and good servant. I did not
                                chose Him but he chosed me first, I did not call Him but called me first. He is the alpha and omega, the creator of heaven and earth,
                                the author and the finisher of our faith. He is the way the truth and the life, that no one can come to the Father bt except through Him.
                                He is the light to my path and a lamp to my feet, that a thousand may fall at my side, ten thousand at my right hand but it will not
                                come near me, with long life He will satisfy me and show me salvation. One of my favorite verses in the bible is in Jeremaiah 29:11,
                                It tells there, "For I know the plans I have for you, says the Lord, plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans to give you hope
                                and a future." 
                                <br><br>
                                God is so good in my life, especially now that my parents are gone, He just prove me that He is the Father to the fatherless. My aunt is a 
                                teacher but her salary is not enough to sustain us. Her salary left her five thousand every month, because of the circumstances while her mother
                                is alive. I am college now, she has a son and family to look to, and with my elder sister we are dependent on her. I did not expect that I would 
                                be able to continue my education, because as far as I know my Aunt's wage is not enough but my God is not the God of limit and shortage, 
                                because He is the God of Abundace and a supplier to meet my every need in glory by Christ richness. If mainly depend on myself, I may
                                be a failure already but because God is not the God of failure so I won't be failure but I can commit mistake. Tahnks for the fact that He is
                                a forgiving God, if you are humble and confess your sins, He is easily and just to forgive us. Until His grace is available, we are free to come
                                and surrender to Himm in a humble heart.

                                    My dream to build our own house, a huge house so that we will not live in my aunt's house anymore and live a living on our own.
                                    I want to work abroad, hoping and believing that is would also be the will of the almighty father. I want to live a life to the fullest.
                                    Sharing the love, laugh and joy to my love ones and friends.
